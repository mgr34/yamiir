> Yet Another Material Implementation In React

This project is my attempt at implementing mdc in react. In the two years since 
I began this project google mdc team has created their own react project. I am
pausing this project to contribute on theirs.

> notes: will not work above mdc 0.37.0. Greater commit history can be found in the ehraf-dev repo

## Should I use this?

No

## Where is package.json

Yeah... I really wouldn't use this project. I am just storing some of the work here
so in case I want to refer back. It was originally part of a larger project.
