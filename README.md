> Yet Another Material Implementation In React

This project is my attempt at implementing mdc in react. In the two years since 
I began this project the google mdc team has created their own react project. I am
pausing my project to contribute on theirs.

> notes: will not work above mdc 0.37.0. Greater commit history can be found in the private ehraf-dev repo


## FAQ 
**Should I use this?**
No

**Where is package.json**

Yeah... I really wouldn't use this project. I am just storing some of the work here
 in case I want to refer back. It was originally part of a larger project.
